# Pod theory
The atomic unit of scheduling in Kubernetes is the Pod.

## Why pods
There are three main reasons for Pods:
1. Pods augment containers
2. Pods assist in scheduling
3. Pods enable resource sharing  

### Pods augment containers
Pods augment containers in all the following ways:
1. Labels and annotations
2. Restart policies
3. Probes (startup probes, readiness probes, liveness probes, and potentially more)
4. Affinity and anti-affinity rules
5. Termination control
6. Security policies
7. Resource requests and limits  
  
Run a `kubectl explain pods` command to list all possible Pod attributes.  
  
#### Some of the pod features are:
- Labels let you group Pods and associate them with other objects in powerful ways.
- Annotations let you add experimental features and integrations with 3rd-party tools and services.
- Probes let you test the health and status of Pods and the apps they run.
> This enables advanced scheduling, updates, and more.
- Affinity and anti-affinity rules give you control over where in a cluster Pods are allowed to run.
- Termination control lets you gracefully terminate Pods and the applications they run.
- Security policies let you enforce security features.
- Resource requests and limits let you specify minimum and maximum values for things like CPU, memory, and disk IO.  

### Pods assist in scheduling
Labels, affinity and anti-affinity rules, as well as resource requests and limits give you fine-grained control over which worker nodes Pods can run on.  

### Pods enable resource sharing
On the sharing of resources front, Pods provide a shared execution environment for one or more containers.  
  
#### This shared execution environment includes things such as:
- Shared filesystem
- Shared network stack (IP address, routing table, ports…)
- Shared memory
- Shared volumes
> This means that if a Pod has two containers, both will share the Pod’s IP address and can access any of the Pod’s volumes to share data.
